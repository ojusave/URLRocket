# 🚀 URL Rocket - Your Simple URL Shortener

Welcome to URL Rocket, a sleek and simple URL shortener built with the power of Node.js and Express. This project provides an intuitive web interface where users can transform long, unwieldy URLs into short, shareable links with just a click of a button.

## 🛠️ Installation

Before you blast off, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.

## 🚀 Launch

To start the server, run `node index.js`in your terminal. The server will start on port 3000.

Now, open your favorite web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You'll be greeted with a simple form where you can enter a URL to be shortened. After you submit the form, you'll be redirected to a page displaying your new, shortened URL. You can also replace `http://localhost:3000` with your own domain name. 

If you navigate to the shortened URL, you'll be redirected to the original URL. It's that simple!

## ⚠️ Note

While URL Rocket is a powerful tool, please note that this is a basic implementation and not suitable for a production environment. In a real-world application, you would want to use a persistent database, handle errors more gracefully, and probably add some form of rate limiting or abuse prevention. But for learning, experimenting, or small personal projects, URL Rocket is ready to launch!
